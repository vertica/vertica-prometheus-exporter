### AVAILABLE TOOLS COMPARISON: 
This is a high level comparison of available monitoring tools. Hopefully it will allow you to decide which is best suited for your use case.

- Vertica Management Console – Comes with Vertica but requires separate install. Only allows monitoring of Vertica databases. All metrics available are chosen by Vertica. It's a static set so the user can’t customize the metrics available or how they are displayed.  

- Grafana plugin – Requires Grafana with Vertica data source be installed and configured. The data source does a direct connection to Vertica to get metrics. There is no caching of results so every refresh is a conneciton/query in Vertica. It runs queries based on the defined Grafana panel intervals. Queries and dashboards are fully customizable so the user is free to choose what metrics they want to look at, how they are visualized, and frequency of refresh. The Grafana Vertica data source supports tables with string values. Requires Vertica SQL and Grafana skills.

- Prometheus exporter – Requires Prometheus and vertica-prometheus-exporter. Prometheus is configured to use the vertica-prometheus-exporter as a target and initiates scrapes from it. The exporter connects to Vertica, runs the metrics queries, and returns them to Prometheus in a known format. The exporter has the ability to cache metrics if desired, which can help minimize the scrapes it does to the Vertica database. The Prometheus metrics can be displayed in Prometheus as raw text, tables, and graphs. They can also be used by any tool that supports Prometheus format, e.g. Grafana with it's Prometheus data source plugin. Collectors (sets of metrics queries) are fully customizable, so the user is free to choose what metrics they want to look at, how they are visualized, and frequency of refresh. They support collector level cache settings. Note that Prometheus doesn't support metric string values, so you can't render a table for non numeric data. Requires Vertica SQL and Prometheus skills, plus whatever visualization tool is being used skills.  

### COLLECTOR QUERY RESULTS
Because Prometheus is time series oriented and has it's own time series database to track target results, any rows returned are considered to be a unique time series. So your metrics queries in the collectors will typically return one row by specifying order by a time oriented column in descending order and limit 1. This will feed just the latest value for that metric. If your metric query returns multiple rows, e.g. a connections per node where a row per node is output, each row is treated in Prometheus as a unique time series. This would translate to multiple lines in a graph or rows in a table in Prometheus or any visualization tool being used. 

### START-UP ORDER: 
Typically you will want to start the exporter prior to Prometheus. This way you can verify it's listening on the port prior to starting Prometheus which will ping that port. The start-up order would be similar to below.

- First start the vertica-prometheus-exporter. Depending on your deployment It should say listening at the end of console output, end of logfile/vertica-prometheus-exporter.log, or end of nohup.out. 
- Wait a minute and then start Prometheus.  It should say listening at the end of console output or end of nohup.out. 
- Now go to the Prometheus http interface (http://<prometheusserverip>:9090/targets. If the status of the vertica-exporter says Down or Unknown wait 30 seconds or so then refresh. Repeat until it says UP. Now you can view the metrics. 

### NAMES: 
Keep your metric names for metrics where node_name is a label short. The combination of the metric name plus the long Vertica node path can result in truncation in the Grafana panels or force you to make them wider than planned. 

**TYPE vertica_query_requests_transactions_count_per_node counter** 
```
vertica_query_requests_transactions_count_per_node{node_name="v_vmart_node0001"} 11 
vertica_query_requests_transactions_count_per_node{node_name="v_vmart_node0002"} 15 
vertica_query_requests_transactions_count_per_node{node_name="v_vmart_node0003"} 9 
```
Notice in this Grafana graph for that metric the node names are truncated because of the long metric name.

### FILE LOCATIONS 
**Non Docker Linux Build**
 
Once you build the vertica-prometheus-exporter binary you can move it to any location you want but the following dependencies exist: 
- You have to launch the binary from the directory where it exists
- You have to have a metrics dir under the binary’s directory that contains the collector yml files. Can be overridden, see exporter -help. 
- You can have the vertica-prometheus-exporter.yml file anywhere you like as the –config-file parameter to starting the binary can be a fully qualified path to it. 
- Your logfile directory must be under the binary’s. The binary will create the logfile dir and the vertica-prometheus-exporter.log in it if they don’t exist. 
 
**Docker build** 
 
By default the vertica-prometheus-exporter config and collector files, as well as the logfiles, will be inside the container. You can use the docker -v binds to allow you config for the files to be external to the container. This makes it easier to monitor the log file and manipulate the config and collector files. To do this:

Make a local filesystem metrics directory (make sure to set perms to RWX for user who will run the docker container)
```shell
mkdir metrics
```
Make a local filesystem logfile directory (make sure to set perms to RWX for user who will run the docker container)
```shell
mkdir logfile
```
Copy the yml files from the vertica-prometheus-exporter tree to the local metrics dir
```shell
cp vertica-prometheus-exporter/cmd/vertica-prometheus-exporter/metrics/* ./metrics
```
Edit the copied vertica config file in the metrics directory to set data source name and adjust any knobs desired
```shell
vi metrics/vertica-prometheus-exporter.yml
```
Start the container using the -v bind for mapping the internal docker paths to the local file system paths (Example here local dir is under dbadmin's home directory)
```shell
docker container run -d --name vpexporter -p 9968:9968 -v /home/dbadmin/metrics:/bin/metrics -v /home/dbadmin/logfile:/bin/logfile vertica-prometheus-exporter
```

### MINIMIZE QUERY IMPACT on VERTICA 
There is interval control at several levels (end tool such as Grafana, Prometheus, and the exporter). Make sure to set the intervals for the best efficiency. Don’t collect slow changing values frequently. Maybe group collections by rate of change and frequency of scrape. See the min_intervals section for more details. 

You can set the exporter max_connections to set how many concurrent connections a metrics scrape will establish. There is no pooling, all connections end as soon as their task is complete. The number of connections will dictate the duration of the metric scrape, but could impact normal operations if set too high. Find a balance between time and resources. 

If planning on rendering several metrics from the same table use a query object asking for all columns desired and then queryrefs to get those columns into individual panels. This will issue one query to gather all columns vs several queries. 

### PROMETHEUS STORAGE 
Prometheus by default retains 15 days of time series metric data. See the Prometheus documentation for location of the database, how to adjust the retention values for size and/or time, and best practices. This is just to raise awareness that the more time series metrics you have the exporter capture the larger the Prometheus database will become. It should be monitored and space issues resolved. 


### EXPORTER STORAGE 
The exporter has a relatively small footprint, but it does produce a logfile that can grow over time. In the vertica-prometheus-exporter.yml file we’ve provided two knobs to manage the log files. There are knobs to define number of days retained and max file size. 
```yml
Log: 
  retention_day:  15 
  max_log_filesize:  500 # in megabytes 
```
Also, if the log file reaches the max size within a single day that log will be zipped and a new log will be started. This further helps keep the log files under control without much user monitoring.

### CLEARTEXT PASSWORD 
To prevent the clear text database password from showing in logs or command history we’ve used a GO secret datatype to store it. The password will still be clear text in the vertica-prometheus-exporter.yml so that file should have an access mask to only allow the user running the exporter to read it.  

### COLLECTOR FILE PLACEMENT 
To prevent false console/log output by the exporter, only put collector yml files in the metrics directory that are associated with collectors you specify in the vertica-prometheus-exporter.yml config file. Alternatively, if you want to keep a superset of collectors but change which you use at different times, then instead of the collector_files value specifying a glob list the yml files individually, e.g. (vertica_base_example.collector.yml,vertica_base_example2.collector.yml).  

If yml files not associated with the ```collectors:``` value exist in the collector files directory, the console output will imply all collectors were loaded. 

#### Example: 

If we have vertica_base_example.collector.yml and vertica_base_example1.collector.yml in my yml dir, but in my vertica-prometheus-exporter.yml config file we only specify the example file and we use the glob, the exporter start output says it loaded the example and example1 files. You can verify in Prometheus that it in fact only loaded the example as specified. 

vertica_prometheus-exporter.yml extract:

**Collectors (referenced by name) to execute on the target.** 
```  
collectors: [vertica_base_example] 
```
**Collector files specifies a list of globs. One collector definition is read from each matching file.**
```
collector_files: 
  - "*.collector.yml" 
```
Exporter startup output 

`./vertica-prometheus-exporter --config.file vertica-prometheus-exporter.yml` 
```

```

### PORT NUMBER in DOCKER
As noted in the README.md the port number the exporter listens on is registered with Prometheus and should not be changed. In a Docker environment you can use the Docker -p argument to assign an alternate external port number if desired. The exporter will still be listening on post 9968 internally but the container can listen on a different port as a Prometheus target.

In the example below we've started the container telling it to proxy the internal port 9968 to external port 9970.
```
[dbadmin@vertica-node ~]$ docker container run -d --name vpexporter -p 9970:9968 -v /home/dbadmin/metrics:/bin/metrics -v /home/dbadmin/logfile:/bin/logfile vertica-prometheus-exporter
```
And this shows the docker container is proxying the port to 9970
```
[sudo] password for dbadmin:
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:9970            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      232008/docker-proxy
tcp6       0      0 :::9970                 :::*                    LISTEN      232015/docker-proxy
```
Now you can set your Prometheus config file target to port 9970
```
- targets: ["10.20.71.180:9970"]
```

**Note make sure to check availability on your system for the port you plan on using as the container listening port before implementing.**
 
 
### Vertica Prometheus Exporter min_interval EXPLAINED 
The min_interval knob determines the lifespan of the internal collector objects. A collector with min_interval=0s will open, scrape Vertica, and close. A collector with min_interval=60s will open, scrape Vertica, and remain open as a temporary cache. Subsequent requests for that collector from Prometheus prior to the min_interval will get cached results from the exporter and not scrape Vertica. A request for that collector from Prometheus which occurs after the min_interval is reached will get a new collector, fresh scrape of Vertica, and again live for the duration of min_interval. 

There is a global min_interval setting in the vertica-prometheus-exporter.yml file. This governs the min_interval for all active collectors. Each collector file can have it’s own min_interval setting, allowing you to control how frequently a Prometheus request actually causes a scrape against Vertica. 

`[dbadmin@vertica-node metrics]$ head vertica-prometheus-exporter.yml `
```
global: 
  scrape_timeout_offset: 500ms 
  min_interval: 10s 
```
`[dbadmin@vertica-node metrics]$ head vertica_base_graphs.collector.yml`
```
collector_name: vertica_base_graphs 
min_interval: 75s 
```
`[dbadmin@vertica-node metrics]$ head vertica_base_gauges.collector.yml`
```
collector_name: vertica_base_gauges 
min_interval: 0s 
```
In the exporter log file you can see the collectors being created, aged, and the return of cached metrics vs fresh metrics. Above you can see that global value is 10s, and graphs collection is set to 75s. Below the log entries for Prometheus requests for graph metrics show the new collector, return of cached metrics, age reached, and return of fresh metrics. 

**first collection collector age is a large number, subsequent ones will return normal values for age:** 
```
INFO[2022-09-12T15:08:51-04:00] [collector="vertica_base_graphs"] Collecting fresh metrics: min_interval=75.000s cache_age=9223372036.855s 
```
**here we see that Prometheus will get cached metrics because the collector has not yet reached min_interval (lifespan)**
```
INFO[2022-09-12T15:09:51-04:00] [collector="vertica_base_graphs"] Returning cached metrics: min_interval=75.000s cache_age=59.990s 
```
**when the cache reaches min_interval (lifespan) then Prometheus will get a new collector and new metrics from Vertica:**
```

```
**you can see the difference between cached and fresh. The fresh shows columns returned from Vertica**

```
So using the min_intervals at the collector level allows you to control how often Prometheus gets up to date results, and how often Vertica is queried. You could potentially create collectors which you want real time results every request (min_interval=0s), reasonably real time results for fast moving metrics (min_interval=60s), and periodic results for slow moving metrics (min_interval=600s). 

*Note: if you set min_interval shorter than the Prometheus scrape interval you will get a fresh scrape every time. So make sure to review Prometheus scrape interval before setting the exporter min_intervals.* 

*Tuning hint. If you are using min_interval > 0s you can grep the log file to compare the number of cached (no Vertica scrape) to fresh (Vertica scrape) results. This may help you decide if you want to adjust for more or fewer Vertica scrapes for the particular metric.*
